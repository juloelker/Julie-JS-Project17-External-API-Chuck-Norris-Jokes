# Julie-JS-Project17-External-API-Chuck-Norris-Jokes

Update, 11/9/2021: I tweaked the Javascript a little and decided to upload again.  The changes are minor, but it's a chance to practice branching and making a PR.

This is my first attempt at using a GET request and a simple external API, ICNDb.com (the Internet Chuck Norris Database), to pull in data.  It's a bunch of Chuck Norris jokes, loaded randomly into my app, as taught by Traversy Media.  I improved it by getting jokes only from the "nerdy" category. I wanted to eliminate the explicit ones and this was one way to do it.
