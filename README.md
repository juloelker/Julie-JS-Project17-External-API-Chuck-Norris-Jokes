# Julie-JS-Project17-External-API-Chuck-Norris-Jokes

This is my first attempt at using a GET request and a simple external API, ICNDb.com (the Internet Chuck Norris Database), to pull in data.  It's a bunch of Chuck Norris jokes, loaded randomly into my app, as taught by Traversy Media.  I improved it by getting jokes only from the "nerdy" category. I wanted to eliminate the explicit ones and this was one way to do it.
